# hangman
Interactive Hangman Game with Ruby2d

This program is an interactive Hangman game coded in Ruby using the Ruby2d gem. Right now, the game is quite simple. It selects one word from a list of about 20 words that I hard-coded into there and then draws the appropriate number of spaces for the letters of that word. Then, as the user enters their guesses for the letters, it either displays the letter over its appropriate letter space or the program begins to draw the Hangman. After 5 incorrect answers, the game clears and it displays 'Game Over!'. To restart, the user needs to close the window. 

To run this program, it is necessary to download the code itself (hangman.rb) and each of the PNG's that comprise up the hangman display (hangman.png , arms.png, legs.png, body.png). This program can be run from the Terminal or a software like VSCode.

In the future, I would like to refine the ending of the game, possibly allowing a restart option that doesn't require the window to close and adding more words to the word bank.
